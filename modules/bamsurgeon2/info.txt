Running Bamsurgeon was pretty straightforward, it is setup in /home/gavinp/Downloads/new_bamsurgeon/bamsurgeon.
There is a python virtualenv in in /home/gavinp/Downloads/new_bamsurgeon/bamsurgeon/bams_p27/bin/activate.sh that has the dependencies for Bamsurgeon.

I used addsnv.py and the test set in /home/gavinp/Downloads/new_bamsurgeon/bamsurgeon/test_data/random_snvs.txt <- this is a test data set that comes with Bamsurgeon, it has 100 SNPs on chr22.
There is an optional parameter (the fourth column) that sets the VAF. The first 7 rows in this test dataset have VAF set.
There are some shell scripts there that show the commands I ran on the PrecisionFDA data:
I generated SNP modified BAMs using Bamsurgeon’s addsnv.py through the shell script run_bamsurgeon.sh. It uses random_snvs.txt which is a list of coordinates and possibly VAF. 
I generated indel modified BAMs using Bamsurgeon’s addindel.py through the shell script run_bamsurgeon_indels.sh. It uses a list of deletions (coordinates) and insertions (coordinates and sequence). VAF is optional.
The truth is in the input txt file for each (e.g. random_snvs.txt) 

I don’t remember exactly how long it took to run, I think a few hours or less?
