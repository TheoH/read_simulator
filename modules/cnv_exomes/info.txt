Hi Theo,
 
R script is in:      /sw/trunk/test/bin/structural_vars/simulation/RSVSim_Exomemult_samples_2ref_par.R
capsim bash script:  /sw/trunk/test/bin/structural_vars/simulation/run_capsim.sh
 
In my sim environment they’re both in

/staging/gavinp/struct_vars/CNV/simul/RSVSim/exome
 
Capsim is from https://github.com/mdcao/capsim, there are installation instructions there or the bash script above points to an installation that is in my home directory.
My capsim script uses gnu parallel for parallelization – also I think I needed a newer version of samtools for capsim.
 
I’ll check the probe files into perforce next.
 
Gavin.
